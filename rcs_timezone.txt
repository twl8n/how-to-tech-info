title:RCS Keywords, date, etc. and timezone hints
keywords:rcs,ci,co,cvs,time,zone,udt,keywords,date,id,revision,
description:Keyword variables available in RCS, and how to force the timezone to be local.


See "man co" for RCS keywords including:

$Author$
$Date$
$Header$
$Id$
$Locker$
$Log$
$Name$
$RCSfile$
$Revision$
$Source$
$State$

Dates default to UDT (heaven only knows why they don't default
to the local timezone). I tried entering -zEDT, but that resulted in
some very strange looking timestamps. -zLT memnonic for Local Timezone
works just fine. 

CVS has the same "feature", but I haven't bothered to figure out if
the -z option works with CVS or what is necessary to get CVS to use
the local timezone.

Checkin your file with a command like this:

ci -zLT -m"checkin comment" -l file


Here is an example snippet from of Perl source:
