#### Remove software you don't need.

Uninstall Oracle Java and related Java Applet Plugin. 

https://java.com/en/download/help/mac_uninstall_java.xml

```bash
sudo rm -fr /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin
sudo rm -fr /Library/PreferencePanes/JavaControlPanel.prefPane
sudo rm -fr ~/Library/Application\ Support/Oracle/Java
```

`ps aux | grep -i java`

/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Resources/Java Updater.app/Contents/MacOS/Java Updater -bgcheck

Reboot after uninstall, and launchctl will remove non-existing programs. Before uninstalling, you can see com.oracle.java.Java-Updater in the launchctl list.

`launchctl list | grep java`

```

Manuscript, paper, article, doi, full versions, access options. Scientific research should be free for everyone to read. Sci-Hub supports open publication of research, most of which was paid for with our tax dollars. "the first website in the world to provide mass & public access to research papers". Publishers who hide scientific work behind paywalls would seem to favor their own profit over the welfare of the human race.

#### Text editors, Emacs, vi, vim, Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Enhanced Emacs experience, especially for beginners. May be easier and/or more sane than default Emacs. Note that you will probably also have a better experience with Emacs if you get a .emacs configuration file from a friend.

#### SQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite

SQLite, shell (bash). Quick, fun intro programming demos, working examples. A short intro to SQL using SQLite. This should work fine for all Mac users since SQLite is pre-installed by Apple. Windows users might have to install SQLite.

#### Clojure

Online Clojure compiler, Online Clojure IDE, and online Clojure REPL. Code Clojure, compile Clojure, run Clojure, and host your programs and apps online for free.
This is a quick and easy way to type in and run Clojure from a web browser. The "REPL" is "read, evaluate, print, loop": read some code, run it, print the result, and loop through the process until all the code is executed.

https://repl.it/languages/clojure

A Clojure babushka for the grey areas of Bash. Really, a Clojure interpreter as a native application with fast launch times. It is intended as a bash scripting replacement, but really is a (near) full release of Clojure as an interpreter. This also may be the easiest way to start learning Clojure. You only need a text editor and babashka. The normal Clojure tool chain has complexities and pecularities. The tooling around Clojure is (in some ways) harder to learn than the language.

#### Programming languages

PHP is probably the most horrible, poorly designed, bug ridden piece of crap in existence. I wish that were an exaggeration, but this quote from the excellent post below covers it: "Virtually every feature in PHP is broken somehow. The language, the framework, the ecosystem, are all just bad." Kudos to Evelyn Woods for this timeless analysis.

#### Education Career

First, Musk should do as he says and fix job descriptions and culture to not require degrees. Second, there's a caveat to "smart guys don't need degrees". Really, those smart guys are just lucky. College (or not) wasn't the factor, just luck.
