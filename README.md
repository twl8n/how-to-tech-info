Manuscript, paper, article, doi, full versions, access options. Scientific research should be free for everyone to read. Sci-Hub supports open publication of research, most of which was paid for with our tax dollars. "the first website in the world to provide mass & public access to research papers". Publishers who hide scientific work behind paywalls would seem to favor their own profit over the welfare of the human race.

#### Clojure

Online Clojure compiler, Online Clojure IDE, and online Clojure REPL. Code Clojure, compile Clojure, run Clojure, and host your programs and apps online for free.
This is a quick and easy way to type in and run Clojure from a web browser. The "REPL" is "read, evaluate, print, loop": read some code, run it, print the result, and loop through the process until all the code is executed.

https://repl.it/languages/clojure

A Clojure babushka for the grey areas of Bash. Really, a Clojure interpreter as a native application with fast launch times. It is intended as a bash scripting replacement, but really is a (near) full release of Clojure as an interpreter. This also may be the easiest way to start learning Clojure. You only need a text editor and babashka. The normal Clojure tool chain has complexities and pecularities. The tooling around Clojure is (in some ways) harder to learn than the language.

#### Education Career

First, Musk should do as he says and fix job descriptions and culture to not require degrees. Second, there's a caveat to "smart guys don't need degrees". Really, those smart guys are just lucky. College (or not) wasn't the factor, just luck.
